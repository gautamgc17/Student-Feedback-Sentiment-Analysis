Questions should emphasize more on concepts rather than testing brain's cramming storage house.","Not upto the mark","Library facilities are excellent in terms of good techniques that are used over there.","Extra curricular activities also help students to divert their mind from their study for some time. University plays an important role in this task.",""

A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student.","The materials or links provided for study purpose is good, clarity in depth of courses but again it differs from teacher to teacher.","Exam pattern and how it is conducted is really seems to be good but it's my first year and when I went to scrutiny for the first time it was not as per my expectations. Teachers have marked the answers as per their choice, they must look for the content rather than the length of answers. So poor paper checking is there.","well and good infrastructure and have trending software in lab    ","library is very well managed and provide needed facilities to us","This university is no1 in terms of extracurricular activities and in encouraging students to participate at their comfort levels. ","Improve infrastructure"
